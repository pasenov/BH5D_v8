29/04/2022 Version 1: The starting point is BH5D. epsilon added as weighting factor in histograms. Scaling factor for all histograms: cross_section/Nb_of_events.

03/05/2022 Version 2: Define new materials.

06/05/2022 Version 3: Change physics in order to introduce nuclear interactions.

20/06/2022 Version 4: Apply correct scaling on y-axis of histograms.

04/10/2022 Version 5: Add angle, energy information at production vertex only for the pair production process.

31/10/2022 Version 6: A test version. Build G4EmStandard_option4 where only PP will be defined. Later, it's advisable to continue working on Version 5 and ignore the current version.

06/12/2022 Version 7: A test version based on v5. Force collision biasing only in the target volume.

21/12/2022 Version 8: A test version based on v7. Replace BOptrMultiParticleForceCollision with G4BOptrForceCollision.
